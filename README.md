# RandomFilePicker
Simple bat file that will open, view, or play any random file within a directory. No directory setup required!

BY DEFAULT WILL OPEN ONLY MEDIA CONTENT, EDIT CONFIG WITHIN FILE TO [CHANGE FILTER.](https://github.com/bandito52/RandomFilePicker/blob/main/Configs.md)

Place the file in your directory and simply open.

### Current Features ###
    Delete - Permanently delete files.
    Review - Opens the file again if you had closed it.
    Reload - Refreshes directory if you have added new files.
    Randomize - Simply press ENTER to randomly choose your next file.
    Custom Keybinds.
    Custom Search Criteria.
    Custom Filters to block/allow executables/scripts/keywords.

### Want a simpler version that strictly opens media content? ###
[RandomFilePicker - Vue](https://github.com/bandito52/RandomFilePicker/releases/tag/Vue) has you covered!

No options or menus.


### Future Plans ###
Plan to keep optimizing as I have recently gotten back into programming. 
Would like to have this in some form of a GUI and different language that opens files in-window and add quicker key functionality. 


### Credits ###
chinagreenelvis, whoever they may be, started this rabbit hole with sharing his code for what I call v1.0.

While I was searching for a way to randomly open any file in a folder, I found a link to his help-post.
